Description: Compute pearson and kendall correlations. using only basic R 
    operations and vectorization. For kendall correlations, it only computes 
    some correlations (see vignettes for details). And it does not have special 
    handling of missing values. As such, it is a partial replication of the
    cor() function in the stats package.
