Description: Compute correlations using only basic R operations and 
    vectorization. It is a partial replication of the cor() function in package 
    stats. This package can compute pearson and kendall correlations, but not spearman
    correlations. For kendall correlations, it only computes some correlations.
    And it does not have special handling of missing values.
